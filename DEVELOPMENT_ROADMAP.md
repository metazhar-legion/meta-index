  - [ ] Implement fallback oracle system
  - [ ] Add circuit breakers for oracle failures
  - [ ] Create oracle health monitoring
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Files**: `src/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol`, new `src/interfaces/IPriceOracleV2.sol`

#### âœ… 2. Flash Loan Attack Protection
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTING  
- **Goal**: Prevent same-block MEV attacks and flash loan exploitation
- **Components**:
  - [ ] Add minimum holding period tracking
  - [ ] Implement same-block deposit/withdrawal restrictions
  - [ ] Add MEV protection mechanisms
  - [ ] Create emergency pause triggers
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

#### ðŸš§ 3. Liquidation Automation Scaffolding
**Status**: ðŸš§ SCAFFOLDING (Future Implementation)
- **Goal**: Prepare infrastructure for automated liquidations
- **Components**:
  - [ ] Create liquidation interface and events
  - [ ] Add liquidation price calculation improvements
  - [ ] Implement liquidation incentive framework
  - [ ] Add keeper-style automation hooks
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 day (scaffolding only)
- **Files**: EnhancedPerpetualStrategy, new interfaces

#### ðŸš§ 4. Automated Fee Collection Scaffolding
**Status**: ðŸš§ SCAFFOLDING (Future Implementation)
- **Goal**: Prepare infrastructure for automated fee collection
- **Components**:
  - [ ] Create fee distribution interface
  - [ ] Add treasury management system
  - [ ] Implement fee sharing mechanisms
  - [ ] Add automated collection triggers

### ðŸ”¶ MEDIUM PRIORITY - NEXT ITERATION

#### ðŸš€ Quick Wins (Can Implement Now)
- [ ] **Gas Optimization**: Pack structs, use uint128 where appropriate (1 day)
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Messages**: Add detailed revert reasons (0.5 day)  
- [ ] **Event Improvements**: Add more detailed events for monitoring (0.5 day)
- [ ] **Storage Optimization**: Reduce storage slots in frequently used structs (1 day)

#### ðŸ”„ Deferred (Requires More Work)
- [ ] **Governance Timelock**: Multi-signature and timelock controls (3-4 days)
- [ ] **Advanced Circuit Breakers**: Market volatility-based triggers (2-3 days)
- [ ] **MEV Protection**: Advanced sandwich attack prevention (4-5 days)

---

### ðŸ”¹ LOW PRIORITY - FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

#### ðŸš€ Quick Wins (Can Implement Later)
- [ ] **Enhanced Analytics**: Strategy performance metrics (1-2 days)
- [ ] **Monitoring Dashboards**: Real-time health monitoring (2 days)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs (1 day)

#### ðŸ”„ Major Features (Future Roadmap)
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Hot-swappable strategies (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Multi-chain deployment (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **Advanced User Onboarding**: Interactive tutorials (1 week)

## Current Implementation Session

### Phase 1: Core Security Enhancements (This Session)
1. âœ… Oracle staleness protection with fallback mechanisms
2. âœ… Flash loan protection with minimum holding periods  
3. ðŸš§ Liquidation automation scaffolding (framework only)
4. ðŸš§ Fee collection scaffolding (framework only)
5. ðŸš€ Quick-win optimizations where possible

### Next Steps After This Session
1. Complete liquidation automation implementation
2. Complete automated fee collection system
3. Implement governance controls with timelock
4. Advanced circuit breaker mechanisms

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Oracle Protection Strategy
- Implement multi-oracle architecture with weighted averages
- Add maximum age checks (heartbeat validation)
- Create fallback to Chainlink, then Uniswap TWAP, then manual override
- Add circuit breakers that pause operations on oracle failure

### Flash Loan Protection Strategy  
- Track last interaction block per user
- Implement minimum holding periods (e.g., 1 block for small amounts, more for large)
- Add same-block operation restrictions
- Monitor for unusual trading patterns

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- All new features require comprehensive tests
- Security-focused code reviews
- Gas optimization analysis for new functions

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Maintain 100% test success rate
- [ ] No reduction in gas efficiency for common operations
- [ ] Enhanced security without sacrificing usability
- [ ] Proper event emission for monitoring and analytics
